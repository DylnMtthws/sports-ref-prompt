# Sports Reference Software Engineer Internship Prompt

This project demonstrates my ability to build a web application that generates a head-to-head table using JavaScript, similar to those seen on the Sports Reference website. It was created in response to the engineering internship prompt at Sports Reference LLC, and I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity to contribute to your talented team.

# How to Run this App

1. run ```npm i json-server``` if you do not have json-server installed
2. run ```json-server --watch data.json``` to get the server running
3. open the index.html file in the browser to view the rendered table

# About Me

My passion for sports goes beyond just watching games. I'm fascinated by the data and analytics that tell the stories behind them. This project allowed me to combine my technical skills with my love for sports data, and I'm eager to explore this intersection further through an internship at Sports Reference.

My first project at The Flatiron School was inspired by my love of FBRef! It is a single-page JS web app that functions as an admin page to manage an English Premier League xGD table. View the code here: https://github.com/DylnMtthws/Phase-1-Project-DoesMyTeamSuck-2.0

Thank you for considering my application. I'm confident my dedication, technical skills, and enthusiasm for sports analytics would be valuable assets to your team.
